Android app to pull arrival times from OCtranspo live data feed - no frills dashboard style

Background

I developed this app to answer my bus stop usage.  As a regular expres and 95 route user I needed something that just focused on times without all the other overhead.  My goal was to creat a live dashboard that could answer next trip in a quick glance - not extra screen, pop-ups or look ups.  It is assumed that daily users know which stops and buses they use.  

Bugs and Issues

Actually this is very stable, there are littlq quirks but no issues.  Probably the only thing I would add is that current compiles through MIT app inventor do not allow background operation of app while in sleep mode.

Source Code:

The source code is directly from MIT app inventor.  This is a fantastic platform for creating apps with out having to bother with syntax.  However coding logic does help and I have had some expeience in my early years with basic and C that helped to understand the logic over development

Other 

There is a structure for creating alarm system but without full background functionality it really on useful while you are dong othing things are your android device.

I hope you find this source doc useful for your own creations

Basic instruction:  
1.  follwo the MIT app developer guides
2.  You will need your own OCtranspo App id code and API key for the name of your app
