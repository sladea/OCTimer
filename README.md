Android app to pull arrival times from OCtranspo live data feed - no frills dashboard style

Background

I developed this app to answer my bus stop usage on android.  As a regular express and 95 route user I needed something that just focused on times without all the other overhead.  My goal was to create a live dashboard that could answer next trips in a quick glance - no extra screens, pop-ups or look ups.  It is assumed that daily users know which stops and buses they use.  

Bugs and Issues

Actually this is very stable, there are little quirks but no issues.  Probably the only thing I would add is that current compile through MIT app inventor does not allow background operation of app while in sleep mode.

Source Code:

The source code is directly from MIT app inventor (http://www.appinventor.mit.edu/).  This is a fantastic platform for creating apps without having to bother with syntax.  However coding logic does help and I have had some experience in my early years with basic and C that helped to understand the logic of development

Other 

There is a structure for creating alarm system but without full background functionality its really only useful while you are doing other things on your android device but not when its sleeps

Basic instructions:  
1.  follow the MIT app developer guides to install on your development environment
2.  You will need your own OCtranspo App id code and API key for the name of your app - you can get that here:  http://www.octranspo1.com/developers/register

I will try to provide more documentation on fields and structure as time permits.
